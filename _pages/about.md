<h3 id="what-is-this-blog-about">What is this blog about?</h3>

<p>I plan to ramble on about things I find interesting.  SQL, PowerShell, technology tools, and my family will be the most common, perhaps in that order.  Many posts might be reminders for future reference or something complex that I don't want to forget.</p>

<h3 id="who-are-you">Who are you?</h3>

<p>I live in Brunswick, Ohio and spend my days supporting and building solutions as a Senior Database Administrator working remotely for an insurance company in Connecticut.  My various passions include science, SQL, technology, automation, AI, PowerShell, fishing, and spending time with my wife and kids.</p>
